# Open Program

A simple Python script and batch file combination to bring a specific program window to the front using the `pygetwindow` library. This script was initially developed to work with [DisplayPad](https://mountain.gg/keypads/displaypad/) to address the challenge of bringing applications like Microsoft Teams to the forefront.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- `pygetwindow` library installed (`pip install pygetwindow`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the `pygetwindow` library by running `pip install pygetwindow`.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the directory where you've downloaded or cloned the repository.
6. Run the batch file with the desired program title as an argument:

```batch
open_program.bat "Microsoft Teams"
```
Replace "Microsoft Teams" with the title of the program you want to bring to the front.

## About
This project provides a convenient way to activate and bring to the front a specific program window based on its title. It utilizes the pygetwindow library to interact with windows and bring the desired program to the foreground. The script was designed to work seamlessly with DisplayPad to improve the workflow of managing and opening applications.
